# Soil-Moisture-Content-Detection
The project aims at monitoring water content in soil by using a moisture detection sensor and notifying the user using Blynk mobile application as and when the water content drops below a certain threshold. This project is especially useful for indoor plants which require special and specific water concentrations for their growth and development. It can also be used to curb excessive water consumption in drought-ridden areas.

# Prerequisites and Requirements for the Project
1. NodeMCU
2. Understanding Arduino( A basic understanding of C++ syntax)
3. Arduino IDE to code the nodeMCU
4. Soil Moisture Sensor Module
5. Understanding of Blynk library under Arduino and its application available for smartphones.
